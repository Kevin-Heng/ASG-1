# Paramore's band website

My website is for the band Paramore which has been around for more than a decade and the website
aims to change the layout of the website to make it easier for users to find out more about them
without needing to go to a different website. This is also to give the website a new look and feel while
keeping the same colour scheme as the current one.
 
## Design Process
 
- As a fan of Paramore, I want to understand the band more to appreciate them even more
- As a new listener of Paramore, I want to find out more about the band so that I can understand 
- more about who they are



I mainly kept the same layout and look of the original website but changed some parts to provide
more information about the band. An 'About Us' page is created to understand more about the history
of the band and their members. A 'Music' page is also created to showcase their albums through their
entire career. Fans are then able to have a greater knowledge on the band and appreciate them even more.



## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to view videos by the band on the page itself
- Feature 2 - users can increase quantity of the items they want to purchase by clicking on the + and - buttons
- Feature 3 - view the album titles and years 
- Feature 4 - view members and history

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- click on the album to view the songs
- back button to return to previous pages

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- HTML - to programme the website
- CSS - to style the website
- JavaScript - for micro-interations such as changing quantity number


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

The website scales down to mobile view and looks the same as on desktop.

I have issues changing desktop view to mobile view.
